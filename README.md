## **Project Overview**

Insurance companies cover expenses the policyholder incurs from damages to health or property policies commonly offered: medical bills, house, motor vehicle, and fire insurance, and financial losses such as a loss of income against a fee or premium paid by the client. Traditional approaches to premium calculation require a lot of time-consuming human labor and are getting more complicated daily to capture the increasingly complex interactions in the data. Insurance firms should normally collect a higher premium than the amount given to the insured individual if that person files a valid claim to generate a profit. Since profitability is the fundamental factor that helps the insurance firm survive, they need a mechanism for reliably forecasting healthcare expenses.

Hence, our goal is to build a machine learning model that helps establish the rates by predicting the charges or payouts done by the health insurance firm to maintain profitability.

In this project, we will primarily focus on building an XGBoost Regressor to determine healthcare expenses based on features such as age, BMI, smoking, etc. We will also learn about categorical correlation, build a linear regression model as a baseline and compare it with the results of the XGBoost regressor. We will eventually learn how to communicate technical results to stakeholders who are not technical.
